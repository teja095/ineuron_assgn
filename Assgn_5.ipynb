    "1. Performance Estimation: Cross-validation provides a more reliable estimate of the model's performance compared to a single train-test split. By evaluating the model on multiple folds, it helps to mitigate the impact of data variability and provides a more robust estimate of how well the model is likely to perform on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Model Selection: Cross-validation is useful for comparing and selecting between different models or hyperparameter settings. By evaluating each model on multiple folds, it allows for a fair comparison of performance and helps in selecting the best-performing model.\n"
